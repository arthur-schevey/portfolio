This project is a command-line spreadsheet application built in Rust, combining an interpreted programming language with a terminal-based spreadsheet interface. Users can define cell expressions, reference other cells, and leverage programming constructs like conditionals and loops to manipulate data dynamically.  

It features robust error handling and a responsive terminal UI using ratatui, allowing users to explore spreadsheet logic without leaving the terminal.  

Key features include:  
- Excel-like formula support for cell references and calculations  
- Conditional statements and iterative loops inside the spreadsheet  
- CLI visualization for interactive navigation and editing  
- Comprehensive error handling for syntax and runtime issues  

This project demonstrates the power of combining systems programming with domain-specific language design to deliver a lightweight, functional spreadsheet environment.
