This project is a command-line spreadsheet application built in Rust, as an exercise to building an interpreted programming language; from lexing and parsing → to evaluation and error handling.

Built with existing tools like Excel in mind, users can define cell expressions, reference other cells, and leverage programming constructs (conditionals/loops) to manipulate data dynamically—all in a terminal.

Key features include:  
- Excel-like formula support for cell references and calculations  
- Conditional statements and iterative loops inside the spreadsheet  
- CLI visualization for interactive navigation and editing  
- Comprehensive error handling for syntax and runtime issues  

This project was a powerful learning experience that served as a foundation for my learning for giving me a deeper understanding of programming theory.
