DSChef is a graph and tree visualization utility designed to make complex hierarchical data intuitive and interactive. Users can construct, manipulate, and explore binary trees, general trees, and graphs with a live, dynamic interface.

Key features include:  
- Real-time node creation, editing, and traversal visualization  
- Support for multiple graph types (directed, undirected, weighted)  
- Export/import functionality for saving and sharing structures  
- Undo/redo

DSChef emphasizes clarity and usability in representing data structures that are typically abstract and difficult to interact with visually.
